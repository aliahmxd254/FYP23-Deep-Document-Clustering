The SNePS Research Group
The long-term goal of The SNePS Research Group is the design and
construction of a natural-language-using computerized cognitive agent,
and carrying out the research in artificial intelligence, computational
linguistics, and cognitive science necessary for that endeavor. The
three-part focus of the group is on knowledge representation,
reasoning, and natural-language understanding and generation.  The
group is widely known for its development of the SNePS knowledge
representation/reasoning system, and Cassie, its computerized
cognitive agent.
