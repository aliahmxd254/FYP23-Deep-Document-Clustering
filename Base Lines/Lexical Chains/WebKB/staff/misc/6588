My Sponsors:  Hercules Amok and Ariel 
Hercules aka Dippus J. Cat aka Dippy Kitty is an 18 lb Domestic Shorthair
who is approximately 4-1/2 years old.  He is an obsessive fetcher - whenever
he hears the sound of a wounded piece of paper, he's there.  He could 
probably teach a Patriot missile a thing or two about target acquisition and
tracking.  He also enjoys 200MPH circuits around the duplex, and full-body
catrubs with full force, as well as the occasional shoulder perch.
He unfortunately Bogarts - when they have catnip, he positions his body
so as to block Ariel from getting to it.
Ariel aka Bitchcat aka Felinoid Chest Tumor is Hercules' sister.  She weighs
12 lbs.  Other than lying on my lap/chest, she enjoys kneading at the base
of my neck.  She is also a shoulder kitty par excellence.  She guards the 
top of my monitor jealously - that is HER perch.  She will also fetch, with 
indifferent consistency.  She is in charge of killing bed mice as well.
She LOVES bread.
They are both the sweetest kitties in the world, and of course adore me.
I have the marks of their claws and fangs to prove it.  They will growl at
intruders faithfully to protect me from harm.  Of course, there is a time 
limit at which time they head for the underside of the waterbed.  Darwinism
in action.  They purr at the drop of a hat, or Pounce, or whatever I'm 
eating.  They always have to at least smell what I'm eating, and will fight
the most vicious beasts of the Universe for Fig Newtons.
Of course, they're not spoiled.
