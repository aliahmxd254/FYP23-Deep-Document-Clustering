CEDAR Home Page
At CEDAR we are concerned with the science of recognition,
analysis and interpretation of digital documents. 
Such documents may be optically scanned from paper
or be created digitally.  They may contain text that is 
handwritten or machine-printed,
and contain multimodal information such as drawings, photographs
and speech.
Our work spans the entire spectrum of computational theory, algorithms,
software/hardware design, and system maintenance.
