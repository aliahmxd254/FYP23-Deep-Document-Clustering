Biography: I'm a graduate student (M.Sc. in Computer Science) at the University
of Victoria. I am part of the  PANDA 
group, which does operating systems research. My thesis work involves
safety and security in download extensible operating systems. I am also
interested in computer security in general, as it never ceases to amaze
me how many hours of work are entrusted to insecure (and therefore essentially
compromised) machines.
 A little security info: 
 Some information on X Window System
     Security.
 Sites of (my) interest: 
  Pat's Page.
  Mother Jones.
 The art of  Winston Smith.
 Vancouver's own  Wrong Records.
  World Wide Punk and  The Punk Page.
 Holy weasels and stoats! the smalls Home Page.
 And, well,  Operating Systems. Stack and stacks of the things!
