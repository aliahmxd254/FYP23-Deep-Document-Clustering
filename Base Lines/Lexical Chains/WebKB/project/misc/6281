Plausible Inference, Classification, and Default Logics
Plausible Inference, Classification, and Default Logics
The possibilities for unifying plausible inference, symbolic
learning for classification, non-monotonic logics on the basis of
probability and statistics are being explored.  This work has many
ramifications, ranging from computational learning theory to the
efficient use of probabilistic and statistical databases.
