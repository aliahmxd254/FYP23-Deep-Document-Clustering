Computing activities 
began at  Iowa State  
in the late 1930's when 
John Vincent Atanasoff 
, a professor of physics and mathematics, built a computer on campus 
that is now recognized as the first electronic digital computer.
The Department of Computer Science was established as a formal 
discipline in 1969, offering from the outset the B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. 
degrees.  The 
department now has more than 2,200 alumni.
