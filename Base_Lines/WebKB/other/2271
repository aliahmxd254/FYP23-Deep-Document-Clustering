 How to submit Phase 3 
 How to submit your support level 
The deadline for phase 3 of the project is Friday December 8, at
midnight.
Once you are satisfied with your project (or too tired to continue)
please set the directories where your files are located to be 
world readable, and send to lorenzo@cs.cornell.edu a message where you
specify the name of those directories.
You will also have to submit a printout of the files that constitute
your nucleus to me (Lorenzo) by 4:30 pm on the next Monday, December
11. When you do so, you may want to spend a few minutes with me so we
can go over your code together. If you want, you can send me mail over
the weekend to set up appointments.
