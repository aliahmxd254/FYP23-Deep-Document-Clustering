Arizona Computer Science: Visiting Us
Visiting Us
The Department of Computer Science is on the 7th floor
of the Gould-Simpson building, located in the southwest corner of the
university campus.
If you are driving, you can park in the garage
located off Mountain Avenue, south of Speedway.
Both of these are shown on the map below.
We also have some
hotel information and a
map of Tucson.
