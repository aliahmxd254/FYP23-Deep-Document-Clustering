Pardon the mess.  This is a work in progress...Hey, that rhymes!
The Department of Computer Science is located in the basement of the
Logan Library.  The offices are in L120, the Projects Lab (with four
Sparc 2s, four NeXTstations, and eight Sun 4 X terminals) is in L125,
and the Senior Lab is in L133 (with the Sparc 20, the Windows NT box,
and misc. Sparc 2s and X terminals).
Accounts on the Computer Science network are available to students by
request.
