 Kaz's Company  
Kaz Works For 
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation 
First of all, Mitsubishi is not Matsushita. Mitsubishi Motors is not the same company as Mitsubishi Electric. Nor are Mitsubishi Bank, Mitsubishi Trust, Mitsubishi Pencils, Mitsubishi what have you. Each of the above are individual companies, more or less as large  as the other. They all have the same surname because they originated from the same Mitsubishi Zaibatsu that started back in the early 1900's.
