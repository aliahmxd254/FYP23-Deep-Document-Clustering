My origins, like those of most people born in North America during this
century, are ambiguous and questionable.  I'm currently a research faculty
member in the 
 U.C. San Diego CS&E Department
where I research CS and a little E (every now and then) in a decidedly
pedagogical manner.  My current interests include
heterogeneous computing for performance as well as research in
parallel and distributed systems.  Consequently, I'm housed quite comfortably
in the 
High Performance and Scientific Computing lab.
My vita
and some of my more recent
publication efforts are here as are a bunch of
 related pointers to other Web locales.
Of course, research is not possible without readily accessible
 coffee 
and
 music 
which luckly are available here in the San Diego area.  Occasionally,
a
 movie 
is also necessary.
