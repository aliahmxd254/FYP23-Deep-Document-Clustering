Minor Netscape Hacks
 Making Netscape do neat tricks
Note: I think this only works on Mozilla 1.x.
 Try replacing the string /jwz/ with
~gid/ in your netscape binary.  Then reload this page
and watch the animation when the page loads. (The animation is the thing in
the upper right corner that does stuff when data's being transferred
and whatnot).  Use a binary editor to change the strings in the
executable program.  Emacs works fine, if you have it; try M-x
binary-overwrite-mode to help avoid typing too many characters.
Enjoy watching the compass spin round and round.
This reminds me of a joke: 
 What's red and green and goes round and round?
A frog in the blender.
 Hmmmm.  If you look at jwz's homepage, the
animation still becomes the compass, even with Netscape 2.x.  There must
be a way to make this work for normal pages, but it's probably more
complicated than changing an ascii string in the binary.  Pull out those
debuggers, folks.
