How to reach Matt.
 Education:
 Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, December 1994.
  CMU's School of Computer Science
 was pretty cool and 9 math classes bought me a Math minor.
Attended summer school at Creighton University, Summer 1992.
     I got my kicks hacking robotics software at CMU's Robotic's Institute.  Where I got to:
 Write real-time robot software at the Field Robotics Center (FRC) and with
Redzone Robotics.
The project is now called the Artisan.
 Researched massively parallel computer vision at the Vision and Autonomous Systems Center (VASC).
 Worked on a VASC project for Kirin Beer  The Reconfigurable Vision Machine Project! (hic-up)
Now, I am a grad student at the University of New Mexico's Department of Computer Science.
Where I do AI research under
Professor George Luger.
I'm getting funded by the Intelligent Systems Sensors Group at Sandia National Labrotories. I do stereo vision.
