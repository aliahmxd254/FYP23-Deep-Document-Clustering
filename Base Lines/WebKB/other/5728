Mummies from Museo de las Momias in Guanajuato Mexico 
These are some pictures from my trip to the Mummy Museum in Guanajuato.  The mummies were displayed behind glass cases.  Each case had a small hole in one of its corners, and as a result the museum smelled like mummy (the smell was the most disturbing thing about the mummies).
Here is the mummy  story  from Lonely Planet's Mexico guide book.

An Internet and database entrepreneur's  performance art piece entitled  "Napping Mummy".  
This performance lasted approximately 8 hours and at times involved laying
pillows down the length of his body to symbolize the entombed mummy.
