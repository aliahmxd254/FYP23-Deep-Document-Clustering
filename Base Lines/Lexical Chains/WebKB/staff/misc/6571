Background
After receiving his Bacherlors' Degree in Computer Science from Rice
University in 1988, Tim Harvery went to PRC, a subcontractor to
NASA, where he worked as programmer and technical lead building some
of the support software on the Space Station Freedom project. 
In 1991, Tim came back to Rice to work on the Massively Scalar
Compiler project.  He helped design the ILOC language and implement
the parser and support routines (the shared
code) which serve as a platform upon which all of the MSCP
optimization passes are written. 
After finishing the shared libraries, Tim has kept busy by writing an
implementation of Wegman and Zadeck's Sparse Conditional Constant
Propagation algorithm.  He also wrote an SSA-based peephole
optimization pass.  His implementation
of dominator calculation based on the algorithm by Cytron et
al. is available by ftp.  His implementation of a Static Single
Assignment form converter is also available. 
Current Work
Tim is currently working on a reimplementation/webification/augmentation of
Preston Briggs' register allocator.
Future work
Tim is going to be looking at new implementations of register
allocators.
