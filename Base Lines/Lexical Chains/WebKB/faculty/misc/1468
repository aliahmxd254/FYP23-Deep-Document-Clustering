Rick is a Professor of Computer Science at the
University of Arizona. He joined the
Computer Science Department in 1989. He has written
or edited five books and about fifty journal and conference papers.  He is an
Associate Editor of the ACM
Transactions on Database Systems, the IEEE
Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, and the International Journal on Very Large Databases.
He chaired the program committees
for the 1994 SIGMOD Conference and the 1993 International Workshop on
an Infrastructure for Temporal Databases. In addition, he has served
as a vice-chair or member of many program committees.  He chaired the TSQL2 Language Design Committee, and
is now working closely with the ISO SQL3 committee to add temporal
support to that language. He initiated the SQL/Temporal part of the SQL3
draft standard.
He holds a
B.A. degree in Physics from Carleton College,
and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from
Carnegie Mellon
University.
He co-directs TIMECENTER, an
international center for the support of temporal database applications on
traditional and emerging DBMS technologies.
His research interests include temporal databases, query language design, query
optimization and evaluation, storage structures, database design, and
software development databases.
