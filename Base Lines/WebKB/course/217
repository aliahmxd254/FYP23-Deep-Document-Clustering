Data Structures And Algorithms
Description
Efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and selection. Algorithm analysis: worst and average case analysis. Recurrences and asymptotics. Data structures: balanced trees, heaps, etc. Algorithm design techniques: divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, amortized analysis. Algorithms for fundamental graph problems, e.g., depth-first search, connected components, topological sort. Prerequisite: 109B.
