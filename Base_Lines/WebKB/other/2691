will he ever shut up?
music gives me goosebumps...
i listen to a lot of music, and also enjoy performing oratorios in
formal choruses.  
while it seems ridiculous sometimes to make this distinction, i listen to
some very different types of music:
classical, including contemporary art
music
electronic, including "trance," "ambient,"
and "techno"
other, including synth-pop, showtunes, and,
well, other.
sorta a shame we have to make these distinctions.
