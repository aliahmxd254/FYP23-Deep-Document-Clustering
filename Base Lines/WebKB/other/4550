 Collective Communications 
 Collective Communications 
 Collective communications 
are routines that require greater than two processors
to communicate in order to carry out some global operation on distributed
data.  This is in contrast to a point-to-point operation such as a simple
send/receive or data exchange.  These operations include broadcast, reduction,
scatter/gather, combine, scan (or parallel prefix). 
These operations can be found in 
 explicitly written parallel applications,
 remapping of data, 
 updating of globals in a distributed 
memory environment, 
 synchronizing a group of processes,
 library routines optimized for the 
particular interconnection.
