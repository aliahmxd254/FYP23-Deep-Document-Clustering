 Computer Visualization and Modeling Lab
The UTSA Computer Visualization and Modeling Laboratory 
focuses on new ways to model and understand systems with
concurrent behavior.   Application areas range from
multithreaded operating systems to chaotic
pattern-forming systems.    Computer animation, image processing,
and interactive simulations are some of the tools used
in these projects.
