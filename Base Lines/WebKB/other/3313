CS6 - Java on the PC
 CS6 Java on the PC
A few people have attempted to put Java on their PC's.
The following is a rough outline of the steps necessary
to move the
HMCSupport
library to a PC
and to create a working
CLASSPATH
once you have installed the 
1.0.2
ftp the directories and all their files
from
 /home/osiris/cs/cs5/java
files and store them in 2 directories,
e.g.,
c:\java\lib\Acme
and
c:\java\lib\HMC
Note, that if you use
ws-ftp
then entire directories can be ftp'ed
otherwise, individual files would need to be ftp'ed.
Look at "The Whole Internet"
for a discussion of ways to ftp entire directories.
Add the line
set classpath=.;c:\java\lib\classes.zip;c:\java\lib
to the autoexec.bat file.
Note:
the
classes.zip
stays "ziped".
It is part of the jdk.
Reboot
Note:
you can send mail to:
pc-system-l@hmc.edu,
the general pc mail list at HMC,
for any pc related questions and issues.
