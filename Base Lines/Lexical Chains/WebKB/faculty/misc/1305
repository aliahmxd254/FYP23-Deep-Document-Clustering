 Moon Jung Chung
  Associate Professor 
Ph.D. Northwestern University 
Goal:  In teaching, my objective is to
give effective instruction in computer science as a rigorous
discipline, assisting students in linking algorithms and theory to
real problems so that students will be better equipped with knowledge
that has lasting value in the rapidly changing field of computer
science.  In research, my objective is to continue my current study
of design process and parallel simulation, and to transfer research
results to industry.
