 The ADMS Project
The ADMS Project
The Adaptive Database Management System (ADMS) highlights the research
contributions of the UMCP DB research group.  Adaptive query
optimization and buffer management, incremental access/update of
materialized views (viewcache), and
client-server results caching (ADMS +/-) are some of the unique
features in this system.
The (ADMS +/-) Enhanced Client-Server Database architecture dynamically
distributes data and processing to (possibly mobile) clients which
can then be deployed at a remote site.
ADMS+/- provides transparent access to multiple
and heterogeneous database systems including Oracle, Ingres, and Sybase.
The innovations of this architecture are  (a) the utilization of mobile
clients having full database management capability for downloading,
caching and
accessing database subsets whether connected to or disconnected from their
heterogeneous servers, and (b) the use of
incremental access methods
for asynchronous refresh of downloaded data on the mobile clients.
