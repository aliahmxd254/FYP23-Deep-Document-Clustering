WWW.ISI.EDU Has a New IP Address!
As of March 21, 1996 10:30PDT, the ISI web server has a new IP address.  If you have reached this page, it is because of one of the
following reasons:
You have referred to www.isi.edu by its IP address, which has
changed to 128.9.176.20,
You have referenced www.isi.edu and your Domain Name Service still
has the old IP address.  If this symptom persists after a resonable
amount of time, please contact your system administrator  with the information
from number 1.
You have made some other reference that does not point to our new
web server.  
To get to our new server, use:
http://www.isi.edu/ if you landed here
using the old IP address
or
http://128.9.176.20/ if you've
already tried www.isi.edu (see reason number 2 above).
Please make a note of this change.
