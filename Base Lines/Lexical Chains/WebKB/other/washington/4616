 Research: Marc Friedman 
 Research 
I do artificial intelligence research at the University of Washington.
My research, like much of the AI group here, falls into two
categories: planning and software agents. 
 Planning 
I built a solver called 
FABIAN  for the classical planning problem.  FABIAN extends the
notion of least commitment to the choice of which action to add to
establish a subgoal. FABIAN reasons about the common properties of
sets of possible single actions that can solve a subgoal.  
 Agents 
I am working with Cody Kwok and Dan Weld on an information gathering
agent called Occam.   Cody  has
written a paper on that.
