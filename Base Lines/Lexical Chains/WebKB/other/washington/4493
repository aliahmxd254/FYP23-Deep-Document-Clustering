Otter Pops Home Page
The Unofficial Otter Pops Home Page
(Home of the Six Zippy Flavors)
Otter Pops are a frozen taste sensation which are greatly
enjoyed by the members of 
Le Chateau 109-d.
Otter Pops were also revered by the late 
Sieg
225 -- in which they were made the official "cold fruity
snack."
However, referring to the sacred pops as a mere "cold fruity snack" is
to make a mockery of their nobility, and the Six Zippy Flavors
which they embody.  To learn more about the Six Zippy Flavors,
we suggest you explore the options available to you on the 
Otter Pops main menu.
