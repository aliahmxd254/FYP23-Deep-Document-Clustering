 Okay, Okay I have finally got around to making myself a homepage.  This is not because I have resorted to geek-ville (as you can see it is not all that fancy), but mostly because I have been harassed so much by the geeks I work with, I thought I better appease them.  So here it is...
 About Me
 TA Stuff... 
 My Course Stuff...
 My Photos...
 So that is all I hope you enjoyed it....
