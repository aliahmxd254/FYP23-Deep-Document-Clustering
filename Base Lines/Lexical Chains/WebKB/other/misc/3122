Evolutionary Computation provides
an international forum for facilitating and enhancing the exchange
of information among researchers involved in both the theoretical
and practical aspects of computational systems of an evolutionary
nature.
The journal publishes both theoretical and practical developments
of computational systems drawing their inspiration from nature,
with particular emphasis on evolutionary models of computation
such as genetic algorithms (GAs), evolutionary strategies (ESs),
classifier systems (CSs), evolutionary programming (EP), and
other evolutionary computation techniques.
