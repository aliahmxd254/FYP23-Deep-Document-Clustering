T-shirt Design
I made this t-shirt design for the MP/Multimedia group at Intel during
the summer of 1996.  The "4-core 1-cache Pentium Pro" designates the
MP part of the group and the parallel nature of multimedia ISA
extensions such as MMX (ofcourse Intel is not working on any such
CPU--this is just a joke...).  The cool cafe and dinosaurs designate
the Multimedia part of the group.
