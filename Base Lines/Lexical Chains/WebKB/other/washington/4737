I've been the teaching assistant for the
	graduate AI course in my department.
For my class on 
	human-computer interface design, I observed an
	espresso stand in action. Then I attempted
	to observe a subject's  mental models
	as he navigated a web site.
I also worked on Goldberg, a music composition
assistant as a personal project and for my course in user interfaces.
Here's my current office, 
which is in the chateau,
and my late and lamented previous office.
