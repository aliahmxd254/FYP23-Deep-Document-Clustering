Abstract
There is a growing need for parallel programming software
tools that make writing parallel programs easier. The goal is to
provide transparent communication in a message passing
multiprocessor environment. We have implemented a software package
using C++ that meets this need. In this paper we describe the design
and implementation of Global Pointers over C++ and Active
Messages. In addition, several issues concerning implementation and
solutions are discussed. A performance summary and a few
examples of the use of our system are included.
