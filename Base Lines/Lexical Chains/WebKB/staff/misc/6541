Welcome to Michigan State University!
I work in the Department of
Computer Science,
helping keep our computing
facilities running.
In real life I am a parent, spouse, writer, struggling
Catholic, volunteer, posttranssexual
queer, and am generally involved
in far too many things, as ENFP
personalities often are. (But I am an inner-directed
ENFP, which confuses the heck out of a lot of people.)
A few of my favorite links
My resume,
and some mundane essays
Religion is very important to me
DOMA doesn't defend my marriage!
Transgender issues and information
Campus Lesbian-Bi-Gay and/or Trans support
Photos: me with my brother,
my kids, and a link to
their mother's page.
Peace be with you!

"It seems a simple lesson, even trite. But passing
never works, the lie always distances you from those
who aren't party to it. Society may reward the lie,
may even demand it, but the passing person is punished
for passing--either by being caught in the lie or by
believing it. Every closet is a prison, whether it is
a construct of sex or of class. Passing kills, it
annihilates who we are. And keeps us from who we could
be."

Radical Life, Firebrand Books.)
