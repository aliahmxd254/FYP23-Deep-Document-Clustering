CSE/ENGR 142 Textbook Code
CSE/ENGR 142: Computer Programming I
Textbook Code
The sample C code appearing in most of the figures in the textbook
  Problem Solving and Program Design in C,
  second edition,
  by Jeri R. Hanly and Elliot B. Koffman
  (c. 1996, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company)
are contained in the files 
 here.
Each figure is in a separate file, and each chapter's files are in a
separate directory.  
Note that most of these files are not pure C code, but also contain
other information such as sample input/output from the program.
This should be edited- or commented out before running the samples.
