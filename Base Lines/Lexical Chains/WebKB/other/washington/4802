  Mail Stop for UWCSE  
UW Box Numbers
The University of Washington is changing the way mail is delivered.
Once upon a time, the CSE department was addressed by sending mail
to mail stop ``FR-35''.
Now it's addressed by sending it to ``Box 325350''.
Rumor has it that it's important that the address
appears in the order
University of Washington, Box number.
That is:
Department of Computer Science & Engineering
University of Washington
Box 352350
Seattle, Washington 98195 USA 
 What's that ``FR-35''? 
What's that ``FR-35'' in the old address?
It's the mail stop for the
	Department of Computer Science & Engineering.
The ``FR'' comes from the building that CS&E used to be in.
