Charles's weird and wonderful homepage

Welcome to this newly constructed homepage!  Random inspiration struck me to
get my act together and actually put a homepage up.  It's not much, but it 
takes up disk space, which is at least one of the purposes of a home page.
Consider this page to be under heavily abandoned construction.
And now... the links!
Who is this Charles Cruden guy anyway?
Some links I frequent
BBS stuff
