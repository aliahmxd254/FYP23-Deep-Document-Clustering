 1  Heat diffusion - this time using MPI
  Rewrite your heat diffusion simulation using MPI. Alternatively, you may develop any similar application using MPI.
  Compare the "ease" of programming as well as the performance of the two implementations. It might be nice to divide the running time up into a "communication time" and a "computation time", if possible, and use these timings to compare the two implementations.
