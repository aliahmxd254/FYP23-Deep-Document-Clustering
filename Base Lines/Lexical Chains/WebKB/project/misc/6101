Multipol
Multipol is a library of distributed data structures, designed to ease
the programming of "irregular" problems on large scale,
distributed-memory multiprocessors.  Multipol structures are divided
into state structures and scheduling structures.  The state structures
include hash tables, sets, and trees, and use a combination of
replication, partitioning, and software-controlled caching for good
locality.  The scheduling structures are various kinds of queues that
provide good load balancing without destroying the locality required
by the state structures in the application.
