 Some family photos
A color picture of me and my family on the big drop at
	Splash Mountain at Walt Disney World, Florida.  It is
	easy to see who's really afraid (me) and who's having fun  
	(everyone else).
	 A black-and-white silouette drawing of me, my husband, and my son created by a Walt Disney World artist in September 1993
	 A color photo of my friend Lee Peters on his horse, Pepper
