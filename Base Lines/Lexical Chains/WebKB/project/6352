ParaDucks Research Group, University of Oregon
Welcome to...
ParaDucks is a research group in the 
Computer & Information Science
Department at the 
University of Oregon in 
Eugene, 
OR. 
Led by Dr. Allen Malony and 
Dr. Janice Cuny, we are working on
several projects related to parallel computing, performance analysis,
computational science, and visualization.
These pages provide access to much of our work, including 
the projects we are currently working on, 
publications available online, the 
people who make up our research group, and 
pictures of ParaDucks and their surroundings.
The ParaDucks web site is also home to the Oregon Picture
Album, a beautiful collection of Oregon scenery photographed and
presented by founding ParaDucks member Bernd Mohr.
