Background
After earning a B.S. in
Mathematics from
Davidson College in 1986 and an M.S. in
Computer Studies from
N. C. State University in 1988,
I worked at
Shell Oil Company where I developed
workstation-based interactive graphics applications used for seismic
interpretation.
My resume is available in PostScript or
HTML.
Related Work
In 1992, I entered the Ph.D. program in the 
Computer Science Department at Rice
University and soon joined the
Massively Scalar Compiler
Project.
My first project was to rewrite the dead code
elimination pass of the compiler in
nuweb.
I have written a nuweb
version of the global value numbering algorithm
described by Alpern, Wegman, and Zadeck in Detecting
Equality of Variables in Programs.
I have also implemented extensions to the algorithm to handle commutative
operations, to eliminate redundant stores (i. e., stores where
the value in memory will not change), and to remove operations based on
available expressions.
Preston Briggs, Tim Harvey, and I have made several improvements to the
SSA
construction algorithm.
I have written a nuweb
version of several types of
value
numbering.
The implementation includes value numbering over the dominator tree as
well as SCC-based value numbering.
Currently, I am working on improvements to graph coloring register
allocation.
Current Research
