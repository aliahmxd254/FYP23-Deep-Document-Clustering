 CS100 Program 6 
 CS100 Program 6 
 Due:  Tuesday, April 30, 1996. 
 Program 6 Notes 
 There is a built-in function named "fabs" that computes the absolute
value function on doubles, which you will probably want to use.  There
is a function called "abs" as well, but this one has an integer
argument.  
 In the Program 6 folder there is a file called "tests" which
describes some additional tests you should run and hand in for Part 2,
along with the answers that should be produced.  
Here is a link to the program folder:
