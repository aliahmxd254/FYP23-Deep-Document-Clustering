Microrobots
Microrobots
One of the goals of the Microrobotics group of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory is to develop new techniques for the construction of miniature mobile robots.  In addition to building cool little robots, we also are exploring different ways to take advantage of their size for useful and interesting applications.
Current Projects
 The Ants
Microrobots designed to explore ideas
about robotic communities.  One of the potential applications for this
research is  explosive ordnance
disposal.
BF Skinny
A cubic-inch robot designed to compete in the 1995 International Microrobot Maze Competition.
The Rockettes
The goal of the Rockettes project is to build
 small, 10 gram mobile robots for
planetary exploration. That way, we can send many
microrobots instead of a single larger one.
