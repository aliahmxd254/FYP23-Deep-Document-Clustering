Visualization lab
Welcome to the Visualization Laboratory of the 
Department of Computer 
Sciencei at the 
State University of New York at Stony Brook. 
Most of the research done here concerns the development of volume rendering 
techniques for use in scientific visualization. Currently, we have projects 
in: architectures for volume rendering, parallel methods for volume rendering 
(regular and irregular grids), development of tools for visualization, 
flow visualization, ... We also do research in several other areas of computer 
graphics, such as virtual reality and geometric techniques. The laboratory was 
founded and is headed by 
Leading Professor Arie E. Kaufman. 
Our laboratory has a comprehensive visualization tool, the VolVis system. The system is available free of charge in both binary and source format and it runs on virtually any machine that supports X/UNIX/MOTIF.
