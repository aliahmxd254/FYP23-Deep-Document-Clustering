Operating System Research
Here's a list of "hot" research operating systems.
Surely it's biased now, but please tell me if you know
something interesting that's not in this list.
Scout and x-kernel at U Arizona
       Exokernel and Aegis(not Apollo stuff)
       Spring from Sun
 Plan 9 from AT&T.
       This is a html tech report page.
   Berkeley NOW
       Utah Flux
 GNU Hurd
 CMU Fox
 Hive at Stanford.
       Synthetix
       V++ (maybe CacheKernel is the right name)
 SPIN(that's what I'm working on)
