Virginia Tech Tae Kwon Do Club
As an undergrad, I was an instructor with the
Tae Kwon Do Club
of Virginia Tech.
Water Skiing
Over the summer, I spent almost every weekend at my aunt's cabin on Lake Anna
in Virginia. I enjoyed tubing and water skiing.
Here is a map
showing the location of the cabin. I got it from
Vicinity, a free service which can
generate a map to any address in the country.
