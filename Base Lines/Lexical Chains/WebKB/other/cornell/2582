We show here "mpeg" examples for the different categories of effects that we are designing
INDEX
  2D Effects
  3D Effects
 Warping / Morphing 
2D Effects
Curtains
Effects in this categorie make the transition dividing the original image 2D geometric shapes.  
 Interlace 
 Squares 
 Smear 
 Melting 
Blocks 
Disolve Effects
Effects that make a smooth transition between images.
 Grain 
3D simulated effects
This effects simulate 3D effects using 2D techniques and "tricks" but they are not real 3D projections.
 Peeling 
 Folds1 
 Folds2

3D Effects
Forward Mapping
The pixels in the original Image are directly projected on the screen 
 Cylinder 
 Zoom 
 Reverse Mapping
We scan the proyection screen to find the projection of the pixels on the 3D shape 
 Flip 
 Fly 
Warping / Morphing
This is the last phase of the project, we will study transitions based on the distortion of images using Warping Techniques and Fading. Morphing is one of these advanced techniques

Amith has written a simple warping program......
