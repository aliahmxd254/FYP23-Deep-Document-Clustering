Philosophy of the Web
Philosophy of the World Wide Web
This is my philosophy about the Web. It, in no way
represents, as far as I can tell, what anyone else thinks. The Web is a
public place. Therefore people should present personal
information on their web pages only if they are of the mind that their
lives "are open books." I myself susbscribe to the notion of privacy. Thus,
this URL is as personal as my web pages will get.
