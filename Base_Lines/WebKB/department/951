The computer
        science department is part of Vanderbilt University's School of
        Engineering. The program in computer science blends
        scientific and engineering principles, theoretical analysis,
        and actual computing experience to provide undergraduate
        students with a solid foundation in the discipline. Emphasis
        is on computing activities of both practical and intellectual
        interest, and on theoretical studies of efficient algorithms
        and the limits of computation. Students are challenged early
        in their studies to seek original insights. Good computer facilities
        are available for class assignments and individual projects.
