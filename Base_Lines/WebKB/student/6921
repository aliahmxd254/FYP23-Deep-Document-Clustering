	About Myself			
My name is Qian Zhou. I graduated from Tsinghua University, Beijing, P. R. China in 1993 and received a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science. After graduation, I had been working for the China Resources Machinery (Beijing) Co. Ltd. for about one year. Then I came to the States. Now, I'm a computer science graduate student of Rutgers -- The State University of New Jersey.
