From July 15 - August 23, 1996 the  Center for Language and Speech Processing  will be hosting an invited research

innovative techniques for large vocabulay conversational speech recognition. WS96 is the
fourth workshop in a series sponsored by the Department of Defense, the last one having
taken place at the CLSP in the summer of 1995 and the previous two at Rutgers University in
the summers of 1993 and 1994.
