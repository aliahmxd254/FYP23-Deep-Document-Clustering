Kurt Windisch - University of Oregon
I am a Research Assistant in the 
Dept. of Computer Science at the 
University of Oregon.
Active research projects:
	Resource allocation issues in parallel supercomputers.
	Specifically, we are currently looking at 
	workload traces 
	from production parallel machines,
	with an interest in how they can be used in preformance evaluation
	of resource management algorithms.
 A program development environment, 
	TAU
	for the pC++/Sage++
	parallel language.  This is a project of the 
	Paraducks
	group.
 I have a small part in the 
	DAQV 
	(PTools
Distributed Array Query and 
	Visualization) project.
