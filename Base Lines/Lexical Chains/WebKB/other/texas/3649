Fiction
This page contains random comments on various things I have read, generally
fiction, although there may be some non-fiction thrown in at some point, or
at least references to it.  There are also references to other media, such
as 
games
, and video sources, such as movies or television shows.
Perhaps written, in the spirit of
rec.arts.sf.written is more appropriate, but it didn't sound right
either.  Basically, this page covers books I have read and found
interesting for one reason or another. They are organized in no
particular order. 
You can also find out 
what I've read lately
