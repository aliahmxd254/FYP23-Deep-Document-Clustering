I'm a faculty member with the University of Florida's
Computer
and Information Sciences Department.
I'm interested in performance modeling, databases, index structures,
synchronization, parallel computing, mass storage systems,
and distributed systems,
I have developed an analytical performance model of a mass storage
jukebox, for the 
 NASA EOSDIS project.
You can obtain the version 2 model
solver and the accompanying report by clicking 
 here.
You will receive a compressed tar file.
Carlos Guerra is developing Java applets from these models.

My research Assistant, Shiby Thomas, has created an extensible
simulator for distributed search structures.  You can
receive a tar file with the source code by clicking
 here.
My technical reports are available at ftp.cis.ufl.edu:cis/tech-reports.
