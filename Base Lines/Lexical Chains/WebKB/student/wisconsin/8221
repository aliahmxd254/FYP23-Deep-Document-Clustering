The Past...
I  come from Madras, the capital of  TamilNadu ,  India .
Did my high schooling at P.S. Senior Secondary School, Madras.
The coolest part of my life so far has been my Undergrad 
at  IIT, Madras .
I never wanted to leave that place but they chucked me out with a Bachelors in
Computer Science in 1995. I spent those four lovely years at  Godavari Hostel .
We do maintain a homepage for the  cool dudes of the Godav class of '95 .
You can get to some of my  favourite links
