 IMACS-94 --  Physical Elements:
Using chains and cell complexes to solve multiple domain PDE problems
 A brief description of how  has been used to
encode a Lax-Wendroff approximation to the 1D Euler Equations of fluid
flow.
 TR94-1406 --  Chain Models
and Finite Element Analysis  Shows how  is a "programming
language for FEM," by developing a three page executable encoding of a
finite element approximation to plane stress using quadratic shape
functions defined over triangles.
TR93-1375 --  Chain Models of
Physical Behavior for Engineering Analysis and Design  Suggests
that because computers have a preeminent role in engineering analysis
today, computation needs to be explicitly addressed in
mathematical models of engineering systems, and proposes a methodology
for doing this based on algebraic topological concepts.
TR92-1246 --  SimLab:
Automatically Creating Physical Systems Simulators 
Describes a computer environment for creation lumped model simulators
from high level specifications.
ASME-WAM92 -- 
1992 ASME Winter Annual Meeting SimLab Paper 
A later version of TR92-1246 that includes examples from electrical
circuits, rigid body dynamics, etc.
