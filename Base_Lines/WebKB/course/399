This course provides a study of the principles of programming languages. The course will focus on the
similarities and differences among conventional, functional, logic programming, and object-oriented
languages. Topics include formal definitions of languages, control structures, methods for structuring data,
scoping, types, and functions as first-class data values. For each language category, implementation issues
will be discussed, and program development strategies illustrated through programming exercises.
