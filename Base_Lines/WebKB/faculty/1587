My chief interests in research and teaching are Interactive Computer
Graphics and Artificial Intelligence. 
In computer graphics, I teach computer graphics using Phigs+. I'm also
interested in graphical user interfaces, and morphing algoirthms. 
In AI, my research projects have been concerned with various issues
concerning knowledge representation. 
My teaching activities also include courses in programming languages,
databases, and computation theory.
