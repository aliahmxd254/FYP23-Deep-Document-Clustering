 Here's a Bit About Me...
I am a Computing Science graduate student studying in the area
of wireless telecommunications. I completed my undergrad degree in 
Computing Science at the University of Alberta.
While an undergrad student, I participated in the Industrial Internship
Program (IIP), and was employed with Bell Northern Research (BNR) located
in Ottawa, Ontario. I thoroughly enjoyed working with the members of our 
software development team, and the challenges the work presented.
