 David Cassel's home page 
Welcome to David Cassel's home page!
I am a graduate student here at Northeastern University, in the
College of Computer Science.  Very soon, I'll be graduating with a
Master's degree, and moving back to the Philadelphia area.
When I graduate, I'll be going to work for Lockheed Martin in Valley Forge, PA
as a Software Engineer.
By some miracle, I have finished everything!  I'm done!  I'm no
longer a student, but somehow I've managed to find ways to fill my
time.  I can deal with this.  
How about some miscelaneous fun stuff.
