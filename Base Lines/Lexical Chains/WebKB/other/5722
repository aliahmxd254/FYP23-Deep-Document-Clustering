Where did I get these pictures from?
Maryland's Computer
Vision research group (specifically 
Ross Cutler) needed test subjects for a
project involving infrared images.  So, they asked for volunteers, 
promising a copy of our photos when they were done.  
Being the sucker for cool stuff like this that I am, I signed up and
got my picture taken.
