sash's groovy artwork
the first section of artwork is from a set of tarot cards (not yet completed).  I also
have another piece of inkwork- a horde of faces.  you've got to look closely at this one,
and from every angle-  you'll find a new face every time you look at this one,
guaranteed.  lastly, i've got a photograph of his.  he used some sort of manipulation to
combine two different negatives into one great image.
expect more in the days to come (plus links to full images- links to full images
are here!!!).
