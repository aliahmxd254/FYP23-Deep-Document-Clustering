 Those were the days 
Down memory lane ... 
I come from the great land called India.
I received the degree of Bachelor of Technology, in Computer Science  from the
Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 1995. I was in the  Computer Sciences Department   at Rice  University till
Spring 1996 before I transfered to UW-Madison.
