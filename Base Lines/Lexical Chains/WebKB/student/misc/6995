Who am I?
Computer Science and Engineering
PhD student
My current schedule is available in PostScript
form.
I came to UCSD from the University
of Rochester Computer Science
Department, where I was working on a project overseen by Andrew
Mccallum, in which we are writing a Scheme interpreted interface to
a Virtual Reality system based on SGI's Performer Libraries.
I am a Teaching Assistant for the class CSE30.
My office hours are 12:00 - 13:00 TuTh in AP&M 3337A.
My very old and completely out of date undergraduate home page is available here.
My constantly updated, but highly worthless home page is available here.
Warning! That last page will be inoperable from time to time while I play with OS/2.
