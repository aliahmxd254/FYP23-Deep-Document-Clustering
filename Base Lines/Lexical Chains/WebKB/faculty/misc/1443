I'm a faculty member with the University of Florida's
Computer
and Information Sciences Department.
Currently, I'm on leave from the University.  I'm a Fulbright
Scholar doing research and teaching at the University
of Costa Rica.  I plan to return in August of 1997.  Electronic
and snail-mail are being forwarded.
