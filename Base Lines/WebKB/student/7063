About Me
This is me. (Who else?) 
I am a masters student here atThe College of Computing at Georgia Tech. I expect to finish my degree in the spring of 1996. I received my BA in History from Oberlin College with a minor in Computer Science in 1992. After that I spent one and a half years working with Habitat for Humanity International with the Information Systems department. 
My resume in a postscript file. 
So how is the weather down here? Take a look.
