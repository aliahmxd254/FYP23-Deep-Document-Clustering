CS100B Program 4 Solution
CS100B Program 4
Solution
I decided to implement my bigint as
#define DIGITS 512
typedef struct {
   unsigned short array[DIGITS];
   int digits;
   } bigint;
I will keep the least significant digit in index 0, and the most significant
digit in (digits-1).
The implementation of my bigint library.
The Sterling's approximation code. Many programs I saw
used two loops to determine n!. This was very inefficient; you only need one
loop.
