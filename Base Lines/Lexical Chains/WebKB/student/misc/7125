I am a Ph.D. student at the 
 College of Computer Science 
at  Northeastern University .
I am working in the field of Intelligent Tutoring Systems.
Those who are interested in my work may proceed to see how 
it goes.
But if you think than I am more important than my work, you are welcome to 
Katya's very own world.
