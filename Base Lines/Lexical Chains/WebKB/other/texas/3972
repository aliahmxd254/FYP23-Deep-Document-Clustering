CS304P - SAK
Student Access Key
All students in this course are known to the grading computer by a three
letter identifier called the Student Access Key, or
SAK.
To get an SAK assigned, just go to the 
Testing Room
and present your ID to the proctors.
Except for clashes, the SAK will often be the student's initials.
Go get your SAK as soon as possible at the beginning of the semester,
because no grades can be recorded for you until it is assigned.
When the SAK is assigned in the computer, the proctors will also create
a manila folder for it.  All quizzes, exams and programming assignments
done by this student will be filed in this folder. 
Problem Sets
You will also be given a
Green Sheet, so that you have your own record of
assignments turned-in.
Whenever a proctor grades a program or quiz, you should ask them to also
initial the corresponding block of your Green Sheet.
Remember to put your SAK on the bubble sheet of each
exam.
