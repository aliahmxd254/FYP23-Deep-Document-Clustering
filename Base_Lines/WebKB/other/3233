 Module Systems 
X. Leroy.
A syntactic theory of type generativity and sharing.
To appear in J. Functional Programming, 1995.
This paper presents a purely syntactic account of type generativity and
sharing -- two key mechanisms in the Standard ML module system -- and
shows its equivalence with the traditional stamp-based description of
these mechanisms.  This syntactic description recasts the Standard ML
module system in a more abstract, type-theoretic framework.

Applicative functors and fully transparent higher-order modules.
In Proc. Principles of Programming Languages, 1995.
We present a variant of the Standard ML module system where parameterized
abstract types (i.e. functors returning generative types) map provably
equal arguments to compatible abstract types, instead of generating
distinct types at each application as in Standard ML.  This extension
solves the full transparency problem (how to give syntactic signatures for
higher-order functors that express exactly their propagation of type
equations), and also provides better support for non-closed code
fragments.

Manifest types, modules, and separate compilation.
In Proc. Principles of Programming Languages, 1994.
This paper presents a variant of the SML module system that
introduces a strict distinction between abstract types and
manifest types (types whose definitions are part of the module
specification), while retaining most of the expressive power
of the SML module system.  The resulting module system
provides much better support for separate compilation.

 Record Types

      Records and Variants as a natural Extension of ML.
      In "Theoretical  Aspects Of Object-Oriented Programming:   Types,
      Semantics and Language Design".  MIT Press, April 1994.
      Carl A. Gunter and John C. Mitchell.
      We describe an extension of ML with  records where inheritance is
      given  by ML   generic  polymorphism.  All common  operations  on
      records but  concatenation are supported,    in particular the  free
      extension of records.  Other  operations such as renaming  of fields
      are added.  The solution relies on an extension  of ML, where the
      language of types is sorted  and considered modulo equations, and on
      a record extension of types.  The solution is simple and modular and
      the type inference algorithm is efficient in practice. (BibTeX reference.)
      Didier Rmy.
        Typing Record Concatenation for Free.
      INRIA Research Report 1739, 1992.
      We show that any functional language with record extension possesses
      record concatenation  for free.  We exhibit  a translation  from the
      latter into the former.  We obtain a type system for a language with
      record concatenation  by composing the translation with typechecking
      in a language with   record extension.  We apply   this method to  a
      version  of ML with record extension   and obtain an extension of
      ML with either asymmetric or symmetric concatenation.  The latter
      extension is simple,  flexible  and   has  a very  efficient    type
      inference  algorithm  in  practice.   Concatenation   together  with
      removal of fields  needs  one  more   construct than  extension   of
      records.   It can  be added  to   the version of  ML with  record
      extension.  However, many   typed languages with record  cannot type
      such a construct.  The method still  applies to them, producing type
      systems for record concatenation without  removal of fields.  Object
      systems   also  benefit of the   encoding  which shows that multiple
      inheritance does not  actually require the  concatenation of records
      but only their extension. (BibTeX reference.)

    Prompting ML.
    Unpublished Draft, January 1995.
    We add functional continuations and prompts to a language with an
    ML-style type system.  The operators significantly extend and
    simplify the control operators in SML/NJ, and can be themselves
    used to implement (simple) exceptions.  We prove that well-typed
    terms never produce run-time type errors and give a module for
    implementing them in the latest version of SML/NJ.

    Objects with dynamic types allow the integration of operations
    that essentially require run-time type-checking into
    statically-typed languages. This article presents two
    extensions of the ML language with dynamics, based on our work
    on the CAML implementation of ML, and discusses their
    usefulness. The main novelty of this work is the combination
    of dynamics with polymorphism.

This report details the design and implementation of the ZINC

language, which has later evolved in the Caml Light system.
This system is strongly oriented toward separate compilation
and the production of small, standalone programs; type safety
is ensured by a Modula-2-like module system.  ZINC uses
simple, portable techniques, such as bytecode interpretation;
a sophisticated execution model helps counterbalance the
interpretation overhead.

Keywords: binding time analysis, polymorphism, polymorphic recursion
Summary: A polymorphic binding time analysis with polymorphic
 recursion is proposed as an alternative to polyvariant binding time analysis.
 The type system is proven to have the principal typing property, and the
 analysis is proven to be correct and partially complete (unfolding a
 definition cannot improve the results of the analysis).

This paper presents a program transformation that allows
languages with polymorphic typing (e.g. ML) to be implemented
with unboxed, multi-word data representations, more efficient
than the conventional boxed representations.  The
transformation introduces coercions between various
representations, based on a typing derivation.  A prototype ML
compiler utilizing this transformation demonstrates important
speedups.
