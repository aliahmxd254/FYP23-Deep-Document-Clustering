Sandhya Dwarkadas
Research Scientist
Department of Computer Science 
Sandhya Dwarkadas received the B.Tech. degree in Electrical Engineering 
from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India, in 
1986, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering 
from Rice University in 1989 and 1992, respectively.
Since then she has been a research scientist in the Computer Science 
Department at Rice University.
Her research interests include parallel and distributed computing, 
computer architecture, networks, simulation methodology, 
and performance evaluation. In particular, she is interested in 
compiler and runtime support for parallelism, and parallel applications 
research.
As a graduate student, she developed an efficient execution-driven technique 
for the simulation of shared-memory multiprocessors. This technique was 
implemented as part of the Rice Parallel Processing Testbed (RPPT).
She used this tool 
to design and evaluate synchronization support, adaptive caching techniques, 
and the use of relaxed consistency models for a hierarchical 
bus-based shared-memory architecture. 
These results contributed to the design of the Willow multiprocessor 
architecture.
This work also lead to a classification of memory consistency models that, 
in addition to unifying all existing models into a common framework, 
provides insight into the implications of these models with respect to access
ordering.
She is currently involved in the design and implementation of TreadMarks, 
a software distributed shared memory system running on a network of 
workstations. She is developing compiler-runtime integration techniques 
for improved performance.
She has also worked with Alejandro Schaffer on
 FASTLINK,
a project to provide fast sequential and parallel genetic linkage analysis
software.
