Hi, welcome to my
                home page.While the
                graphics and applets are being loaded, let me
                point out a few things you should be aware before
                proceeding. The pages are intended to be viewed
                by web browsers capable of rendering java
                applets, animated gifs,
                and netscape's extensions to HTML such as frames, tables, backgrounds, dynamic updating to documents, and client side image maps. You are unlikely able to go very far
                without these supports in your browser. Time to upgrade your
                browser. Also if you are reading this through a
                low bandwidth link (e.g dial-up connection), you
                will have to be a little more patient while
                navigating. 
Hopefully now the graphics are
                finished loading and the applets are fully
                running. Enjoy surfing and thank you for
                visiting.
