Department Newsletter, September 1996
Stanford University's Computer Science
Department is part of the School
of Engineering.  The department offers the degrees Bachelor of Science,
Master of Science, and Doctor of Philosophy.  It also participates in the
following undergraduate inter-disciplinary programs: Computer Systems
Engineering, Symbolic Systems, and Mathematical and Computational Sciences. 
Founded in 1965, the Department of Computer Science is a center for research
and education at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Strong research groups
exist in areas of artificial intelligence, robotics, foundations of computer
science, scientific computing, and systems. Basic work in computer science is
the main research goal of these groups, but there is also a strong emphasis on
interdisciplinary research and on applications that stimulate basic research.
Fields in which interdisciplinary work has been undertaken include chemistry,
genetics, linguistics, physics, medicine and various areas of engineering,
construction, and manufacturing. Close ties are maintained with researchers
with computational interests in other university departments. In addition, both
faculty and students commonly work with investigators at nearby research or
industrial institutions. The main educational goal is to prepare students for
research and teaching careers either in universities or in industry.
