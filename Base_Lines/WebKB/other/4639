The Particle Tree
The Particle Tree
Oops!  You're not using a browser that's compatable with Beta Java.  Sorry.  No cool Java applets for you. 
Want the source? 
particleTree.java, a minor variation (on the right)
particleTree2.java,
and
fPointTree.java.  Don't expect a work of art, though.
The code uses a technique based (loosely) on particle systems.  Neat stuff!  This code could still use some tuning, though, since some of the things look a little to stringy to be trees.  Still cool, though.
I have another applet that draws much better looking trees using an
LGrammer algorithm.  Pretty cool.  It's right 
here.
