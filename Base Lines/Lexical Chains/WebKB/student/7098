I run Linux on my home machine. Linux is a full-featured, free
Unix(tm) clone that is gaining tremendous popularity (and doesn't even
have a year, e.g. '95, as part of its name!) Here are some useful
Linux sites:
 The  Linux
Documentation Project home page.
 A nice collection of useful  Linux links.
 A  Linux "home
page".
 The  Linux
Archive at sunsite.unc.edu.
 LinuxNET, a fancy Linux
mailing list archive.
Check the  weather anywhere
in the world, including  Boston's local
weather.
 Pick a
