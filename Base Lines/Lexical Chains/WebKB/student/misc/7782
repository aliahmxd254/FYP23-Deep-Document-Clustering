Dan's Home Page
Welcome to my little world.  Stay awhile and have a look around.  I'm a PhD
student in computer science at the Univerity of California, 
Irvine.  My interests are primarily in the theoretical aspects of systems
design: caching, paging, and scheduling.  In the real world, I have a lot
of hobbies and interests, ranging from automobiles to zoology.  If you look
around, you may find something that interests you.
Search the Web with my convenient search page.
To complain send me e-mail.
