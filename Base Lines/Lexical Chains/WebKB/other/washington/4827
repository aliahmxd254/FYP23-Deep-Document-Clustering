Twilight - Introduction
A different light
      governs the night hours.
      It influences
      our perceptions
      and our moods.
      It also reflects
      on our faces.
      This exhibit
      is dedicated
      to these other moments
      and their moods.
Twilight is best viewed
      with Netscape Navigator 2.0
