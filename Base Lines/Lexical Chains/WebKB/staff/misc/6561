Some merges of perl and snmp are available from:
    The DNPAP of Delft University of Technology
(ftp Tricklet),
    and CMU's SNMP folks.
  Literate Programming
The above comes from the folks at 
  info.desy.de
  This is a very hopeful group which has been collecting a terrific
  conglomeration of information on literate programming.  This site
  goes well beyond the literate programming originally introduced in
  Donald Knuth's book of the same name.
Good Stuff for HPs
  Iworks FTP site with a lot of user-contrib type stuff (iworks ftp)
  This is a terrific collection of pre-configured stuff that goes beyond
  the rudimentary computing environment.  Unfortunately the ftpd doesn't
  support enough the unix ls command so you may want to ftp there by hand.
HP-PA Reference
  For those who want to know more about the assembly language for
  the hp-pa 1.1 processor, you can get
  HP's manual on-line.
Precompiled HP binaries
  The University of Wisconsin-Madison's Computer Aided Engineering Center has
  compiled a lot of good software to get just about anybody up and going
  with all sorts of large public domain systems. (cae ftp hpux9.)

   Patches and other important stuff from HP
   can be found at the support

Personal Information
Charles Thayer: research bum
Hello. I'm one of the systems administrators here at the department
of Computer Science at Columbia University.  I have a wide variety of
interests about most aspects of computer systems.  Feel free to get in
touch with me, and certainly let me know if you have any trouble with
this page...
Occasionally I put software (or whatever) up for
  ftp.
For addresses and phone numbers
  finger
  my account.
Find out more about my site, 
  The Department of Computer Science.
 Or more specifically about my group, 
  The CRF.
If you've forgotton to get me a present here's my 
  xmas list.
Since I'm a firm believer in public key encryption, here's my 
  public key.
If you're curious about what sys-admins here do you can take a 
  look at my todo list, which often has entries
  as much as a year old!
