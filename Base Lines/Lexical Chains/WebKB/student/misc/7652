Janet E. Berlin
Fargo, N. D. Police Dept.
    Hello, I'm Janet and this is my wall on the World Wide
    Web.  I'm a graduate student in the 
    Computer Science Department 
    at the University of New Mexico 
    in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  
    Right now I just have some interesting links.  I hope to get
    my skater boyfriend off his butt and put some artsy stuff up
    soon.  Stay tuned.
