I spend most of my day practicing systems analysis in the Computer
Science Department at NMSU. I spend most of my evenings attempting to earn
a Ph.D. from the same place.

Academic Interests
My interests are related to presenting information to the user.
I am particularly interested in presenting both detail and context in a
single, integrated image using non-linear transformations.
I have focused my efforts on presenting images of graphs - there are a
couple of tech reports and a paper in my publications
directory detailing this work.
