Perhaps, as per local custom, I'll have a picture here eventually; I'd
actually be fairly suprised if there was anyone reading this who
didn't already know what I look like, though.  All the usual inane
pointers and silly quotes and random cruft can wait until I have some
spare time.  1996, maybe.
Mail to amb@cs.columbia.edu.  I'm often found wandering around, or try
upstairs.
