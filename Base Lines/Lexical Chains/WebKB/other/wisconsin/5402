 Prerequisites
The most important requirement is familiarity with Unix and C++.
I will  not cover C++; if you know C (very well!) you may
be able to pick up the necessary C++ concepts as you go along,
but this is up to you!  
C++ is an extension of C with several additional features:
function name overloading,
call-by-reference as well as C's call-by-value,
support for ADTs through  classes and
support for object-oriented programming, via inheritance and dynamic binding.
There is a fair amount of on-line
tutorial material on C++; look at the CS564 home page for pointers.
If you are not familiar with even C, you should not be in this course.
