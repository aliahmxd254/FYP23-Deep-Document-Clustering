Computer Science at Dartmouth College
Dartmouth College,
Hanover,
New Hampshire.
``Just a quick note to reinforce from the front lines that Dartmouth's
unique legacy in CS is making a big difference.  As a graduate of '91
working in venture capital in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, I see
that the Dartmouth training is generating many people who are truly
bringing the next generation of technologies into reality.  Keep up
the great work.''   -- Anonymous '91
