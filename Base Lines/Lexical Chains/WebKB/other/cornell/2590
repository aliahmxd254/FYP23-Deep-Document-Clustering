Design and Implementation of Dynamically
Generated Synchronized Computer Speech And Facial Animation 
Abstract:
By integrating visual and audio information using computers,
a new form of human-computer interface has been created. The current
research is in the design and implementation of a user interface
whereby a computer can produce speech (audio) and a moving image
of a human face synchronized to the speech (video). The result
is the appearance of a human talking to the user. The program
is given text to speak (for proof-of-concept purposes, the numbers
"0" - "9"); it then creates the speech, automatically
determines the boundaries between phonemes (to synchronize the
video), and uses morphing to smoothly transition between the images
used for each phoneme.
