 Research 
The current focus is on processing of bi-level images such
as text pages and bar codes. Theoretically, the pixels of
such images can have only two possible values. The practical
situation is quite different. The optical system of the scanner
causes blurring, illumination may be uneven, and so forth. As
a result the scanned images contain a range of values. Simple
techniques, such as thresholding, have serious limitations.
The laboratory has pioneered techniques that allow the recovery
of the ideal image even when blurring and other distortions
are severe.

Recently we have resumed work in the area of interactive
graphics and particularly in problems where image analysis
or image processing can be used to facilitate human/computer
interaction.
