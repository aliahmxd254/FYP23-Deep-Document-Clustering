 Some musical notes 
 John Lee Hooker 
John Lee Hooker has been playing blues guitar since the 1940's
and he shows no signs of slowing down. His most recent albums,
 Chill Out,  The Healer,  Mr. Lucky 
feature more elaborate studio-produced arrangements with 
a variety of younger guest musicians. However, I also enjoy
listening to his older recordings with small groups or playing
solo.
