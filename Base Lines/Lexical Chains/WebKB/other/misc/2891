J. Storrs Hall (JoSH)
I am co-PI of the Rutgers CAM Project,
an ARPA-sponsored effort to design a cost-effective general-purpose
associative memory architecture.
I am moderator of sci.nanotech, and the 
nanotechnology editor for Extropy.
I'm a consultant as "subject matter expert" in computer architecture to
the Rutgers HPCD Project.
My research interests also include reversible computing for low-power
architecture.
