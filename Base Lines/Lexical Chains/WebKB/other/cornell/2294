Dave's Info Page
Hi!  I'm now a Masters of Engineering student in the
Computer Science Department here at Cornell.  I graduated last
year and majored in Economics, Mathematics, and Computer
Science.  I currently work for Professor Brian Smith and T.A. that wonderful
course, 
CS99.  And I'm one of the thousands of Oklahomans secretly populating
and subverting the Northeast (at last count, I believe there are 20 or so
students from the Mother Land here at Cornell).  If you want to start
some trouble or just chuck a few comments at me, shoot.
