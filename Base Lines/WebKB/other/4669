Sorry, you are not using a Java compatible browser
Click on a tile next to the blank space to move it.
History:
2/3/96 -- Added custom update method to make redrawing of the puzzle
iteself happen offscreen to get rid of occasional flicker.
2/2/96 -- The randomize button now works, and the Repeat Last button
currently puts the puzzle back in order.  That will change.
1/29/96 -- Note that although buttons now appear for the
aforementioned functions, they don't actually do anything yet.  Oh
well, at least I figured out Layouts.
1/25/96 -- First put up.  Much more is coming, including a randomize
button an a couple of AI search algorithms to automatically solve the puzzle.
Pretty badly documented source for
