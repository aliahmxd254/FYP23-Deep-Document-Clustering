 Computing Theory 
Description: 
 I am interested in the logical foundations of computing theory and of constructive mathematics.  My recent work has been in relations of logic to computational complexity.  These relations are manifested in proof principles, computation principles, data structures, and programming language types.  Machine-independent characterizations of computational complexity lend credence to the importance of the classes considered, provide insight into their nature, relate them to programming methodology, suggest new tools for separating them, and offer generalizations to computing over arbitrary structures and to computing in higher types.
I also have ongoing interests in reasoning about programs.  My work in this area has mainly been about logics of programs and their relations to reasoning about programs using higher order methods.
