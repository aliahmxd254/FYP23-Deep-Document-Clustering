The Compiler Itself
This page is still under construction.
Software To meet our goals, we are building a prototype
compiler system.  It is intended as a laboratory instrument for the
study of compilation techniques rather than as a commercially
competitive compiler.
The compiler is structured as a series of passes; all the passes
(except the first and last) consume and produce the intermediate
language ILOC (pronounced "eye-lock").
We make the web form of the code for each 
pass available via 
anonymous ftp as it 
becomes stable.  The webs are in PostScript (tm); remember that 
we intend them as guides to help you implement these techniques
in your compiler rather than as things you compile up and run.
