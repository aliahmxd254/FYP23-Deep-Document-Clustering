Aaron Kaplan, Grad Student
I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science at the University of
Rochester, where I've been since the fall of 1993.
Now a year old and still getting 20 hits a week, here are my pictures from Japan.  Who the heck is
still looking at these things? 
Here is a short list of  links to people and
places in my past.
