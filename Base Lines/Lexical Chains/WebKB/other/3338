Academic Dishonesty
Academic dishonesty is fundmental to the activities and principles of
a university.  All members of the academic community must be confident
that each person's work has been responsibly and honorably acquired,
developed, and presented.  Any effort to gain an advantage not given
to all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful.
The academic community regards academic dishonesty as an extremely
serious matter, with serious consequences that range from probation
to expulsion.  When in doubt about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting,
or collaboration, consult the course instructor.
