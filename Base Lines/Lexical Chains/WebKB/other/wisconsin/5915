  Wisconsin COW  
 Wisconsin COW 
Wisconsin Cluster of Workstations (COW) is a collection of 40 Sun
SPARCstation-20s (soon to be) connected by a high-speed network (probably
Myricom Myrinet).  Each workstation has two Ross HyperSPARC processors,
64 MB of memory, and two 1-GB disks.
Those with an eye to computer history may be amused that the COW is housed
in venerable PDP-11 racks.
