  Let us not wallow in the valley of despair. I say to you, my
  friends, we have the difficulties of today and tomorrow. 
  I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the
  American dream. 
  I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and
  live out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these truths
  to be self-evident that all men are created equal.
