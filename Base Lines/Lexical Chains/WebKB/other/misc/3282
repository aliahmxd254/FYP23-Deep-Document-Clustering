Raj's Work Page
Hi, I work on research projects at the Computer Science Dept. at
Columbia University, and engineer storage systems at 
BoxHill Systems -a Columbia University spin-off. My interests are
about most aspects of computer systems, and in particular Database Systems
and RAID Technology (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks).
