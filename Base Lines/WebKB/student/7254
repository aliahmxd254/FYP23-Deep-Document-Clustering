Hi!  I'm Sam Fenster.
Welcome to my home page.
 What am I doing here?
I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at
       Columbia University.  My
       advisor is 
       John Kender.  My former advisor is Terry Boult, who is now
       at Lehigh.
   I'm working on 
       training deformable models to segment medical images.
   Here are my publications.
   With Terry Boult, I helped design Dynamic
       Attributes for the 
       DARPA Image Understanding Environment (IUE).
   I'm a semi-retired
       Office Space Czar.
   I play the guitar and bass.
       Finger me.
