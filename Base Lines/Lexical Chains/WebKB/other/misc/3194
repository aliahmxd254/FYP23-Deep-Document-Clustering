Ariel -> Rule Optimization Project
Active Assignments
Eric Hanson
Write the long journal paper about Gator.
Sreenath Bodagala
Write down the algorithm for pre and post-optimization to 
handle optimization of Gator networks with alpha memories.
Work with Yi to develop new cost functions for Gator networks 
with virtual alpha memories and indexed memory nodes.
Develop design of test database and test rule set.
Include attribute cardinalities and update frequencies.
Develop an update stream generator.
Yi Gao
Develop new cost functions.  Consult with Sreenath and then 
me to finalize them. 
Implement changes to the Gator network optimizer, cost evaluation
functions, and alpha memory structures.
Write masters thesis, including material on new optimization 
algorithm (pre/post optimizer), new cost functions, and your
implementation.
Nick Laurie
Work with Sreenath to load realistic test database
and fix bugs in Ariel that will be exposed.
