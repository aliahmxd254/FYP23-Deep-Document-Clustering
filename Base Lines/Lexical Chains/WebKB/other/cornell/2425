 CS100 Program 4 
 CS100 Program 4 
 Due:  Tuesday, April 2, 1996. 
IMPORTANT: If you retrieved the version of the
Program 4 folders before or just after spring break, the source code
files may have been saved as SimpleText files.  CodeWarrior should
still be able to edit these files, and your program should work
normally. 
Feel free, however, to retrieve a new version of the Program 4
folders.  These folders now have the source code as CodeWarrior IDE
files.
