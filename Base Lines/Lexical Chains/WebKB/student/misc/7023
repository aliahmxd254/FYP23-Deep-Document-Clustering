Working for you...
I was born on October 11, 1967, in Athens, Greece. 
In 1990, I graduated from the Department of Computer Science 
and Engineering of the University of Patras, Greece.
In 1991, I joined the Ph.D. program of UCSD receiving my MS 
one year later. My area of interest is theoretical computer 
science and my Ph.D advisor is 
 Russell
Impagliazzo.
I believe in those who study their science because of love for
her, against the usual
 - pressures for hasty results
 - vain antagonisms for convenient recognition
 - unethical concessions for carreer improvement
and insist on
 - respecting the scientific research
 - trying to unserstand clearly even what is already known
 - striving for learning
 - being free.
